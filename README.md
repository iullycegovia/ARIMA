#  CO2 Emissions Forecasting in the United States using ARIMA Model

# Overview
Welcome to the GitHub repository for my university project showcasing my abilities in R and statistical modeling. The project focuses on forecasting CO2 emissions in the United States using an ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. The primary goal is to demonstrate proficiency in R programming and the application of statistical models.

# Data Source
The historical CO2 emissions data used for this project is from the publicly available World Bank database. Access the CO2 emissions data and related environmental indicators on the official World Bank website: World Bank Data.
